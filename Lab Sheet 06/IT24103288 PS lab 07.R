#Exercise
#1. A train arrives at a station uniformly between 8:00 a.m. and 8:40 a.m.
#Let the random variable X represent the number of minutes the train arrives 
#after 8:00a.m. What is the probability that the train arrives between 
#8:10 a.m. and 8:25a.m.?
punif(10,min=0,max=40,lower.tail=FALSE)-
  punif(25,min=0,max=40,lower.tail=FALSE)


# 2. The time (in hours) to complete a software update is exponentially 
#distributed with rate Î» = 1/3. Find the probability that an update will 
#take at most 2 hours.
pexp(2,rate=1/3,lower.tail = TRUE)


# 3. Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and 
#a standard deviation of 15.

#i.What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ
#above 130?
pnorm(130,mean=100,sd=15,lower.tail=FALSE)

#What IQ score represents the 95th percentile?
qnorm(0.95,mean=100,sd=15)
